# PSIM-Based-Simulation-of-Automatic-Control-Technology
Simulation study of techniques underlying the principles of automatic control using PSIM software. This includes simulation studies of typical links, second and third order system stability analysis, frequency domain analysis, overcorrection and sampling control system analysis, and simulation of a DC motor speed closed loop control system.
